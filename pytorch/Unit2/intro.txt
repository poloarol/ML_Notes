PyTorch -> Based on Torch developed in Lua
-------------------------------------------
1. Tensor Library
    Mathematics: Tensors are genralization of vectors and matrices
    Computer Science: Data Structure for storing multidimensional arrays

    The main difference between a tensor library and array library (NumPy) is:
    They are very similar
        - Support GPU computation
        - Support Automatic Differentiation
    Ideal for mathematic computation
2. Automatic Differentiation Engine
3. Deep Learning Library
