1. What is Machine learning and application in the real world:
- Face or Fingerprint recognition
- Road side speed detection
- Movie recommendation

Computers learn from data:
    - Label data to inform computers about the world, and make predictions

2. How is machine learning related to deep learning?
- deep learning is a subfield of machine learning
- AI is a superset of both deep and machine learning, with them focussing on building
    machines that learn from data
- deep works best on unstructured data, while machine learning works best on structured data
- deep learning is sometimes reffered to as representational learning

3. Application of machine learning
- Making predictions (DNNs, classical ML algos)
    * spam classification
    * object detection
- Compressing data (Autoencoders, UMAP, PCA, t-SNE)
    * exploring large datasets
- Generating new data (VAEs, Diffusion Models, GANs)
    * creating new art
- Learning a series of actions (Reinforcement learning)
    * games like chess, GO
    * robotics

4. Categories of Machine Learning
- Supervised learning: Learn a function y = f(x) given a datasets containing observations and outcomes
- Unsupervised learning: Describe datasets, by identifying patterns form the distinct observations
- Reinforcement learning

5. Supervised Machine Learning Workflow
- Labelled examples -> Training, Test and Validation datasets
- Classification (Distinct value as output)
- Regression (Continuos value output)

6. The Perceptron
- Motivation: How does the human brain work. Analogous to the neurons.
- Inputs -> BOX -> Class Labels (num of inputs are depend on number of variables)

z = (x1 * w1) + (x2 * w2) + b -> allows to estimate the decision boundary

Training
--------
1. Define the Training set
2. Initialize model weights
3. For every epoch
    - Make a prediction
    - Compute the error
    - Update the weights, based on error (Using gradiet descent)
