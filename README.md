# ML_Notes

## Purpose
This repository is a set of common machine and deep learning algorithms implementations, with additional implmentation of foundational papers in deep learning.
The aim is to get familiar with NumPy and Tensorflow V2 APIs. Furthermore, it gives a better intuition of common deep learning architectures and where to use them.

Cheers and Have fun learning!!!
