# ml-study-guide: Implementing Algorithms from scratch

## Purpose
This repository is a set of common machine and deep learning algorithms implementations, with additional implmentation of foundational papers in deep learning.
The aim is to get familiar with NumPy, SciPy and Tensorflow V2 APIs. Furthermore, it gives a better intuition of common deep learning architectures and where to use them.

### PyTorch Implementations
The PyTorch implementations of the algorithms follow Sebastian Raschka's course: [Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://lightning.ai/pages/courses/deep-learning-fundamentals/), hence it will updated as new material becomes available

Cheers and Have fun learning!!!
