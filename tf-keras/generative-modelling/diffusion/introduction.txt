Denoising Diffussion Probabilistic Models

Generative model for high-quality image synthesis

Jonathan Ho, 2020

1. Foward Diffussion: Incrementally adds noise to an image
2. NN approximates the reverse diffusion process which removes noise to generate image

Generative Learning Trilemma
-----------------------------
1. Produce extremely high-quality samples
2. Fast sampling (low- computational complexity)
3. Diversity of solutions or Mode coverage
    Generate data faithfully within the original, especially rare samples
    Long tails of distribution often tend to be important

    a. GANs satisfy both 1 and 2
    b. Diffusion models satisfy both 1 and both 1 and 3

Diffusion models are better at capturing the breadth of the training data's variance
and also beat GANs in image generation tasks. 

Metric to calculate diversity of solutions: Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
    Measure the distance between a sample and two distribution


Intuition behind Diffusion models
---------------------------------
1. Starts with an input sample and add noise randomly to the image, using small step sizes
    Noise is from an independent Gaussian distribution
    Add relatively small amplitude noise at each step
    Add till we get noise similar to static

    This proces is known as Forward Diffusion (Noising) process

2. Use a Neural Network to reverse the noising process i.e. remove noise
