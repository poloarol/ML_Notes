1. Discriminative models determine classes between observed data to aid in making predictions
2. Generative models allow to learn a probabilty distribution to generate new data points
    Unsupervised models
    p(x) -> x`
    probabilistic in nature
    incorporate elements of randomness

Applications of Generative models
----------------------------------
1. Upsampling datasets (Data Augmentation)
    a. Avoid imbalanced datasets which are biased
    b. new data belongs to the true distribution
2. Imputation of missing values
    a. Avoid dropping data, and creating skewed datasets
    b. New data belongs to the true distribution
3. Annonymizing sensitive datasets
