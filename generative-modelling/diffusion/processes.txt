1. Forward Diffusion process

a. Start with sample image
b. Add noise till we have static. Incrementally, with small steps
c. Noise follows a Normal distribution
d. Foward Diffusion process is modelled as a Markoc chain

2. Reverse Diffusion process

a. Modelled as a Markoc chain
b. Neural network learns the parameters of the Transition
c. Neural network learns to remove noise at each step, because noise is added incrementally
d. NN learns mean and variance to denoise images
